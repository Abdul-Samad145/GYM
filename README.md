Gym Website
The Gym Website is a fully responsive and visually engaging platform designed to promote fitness and attract new members. Developed using HTML and CSS (without Bootstrap), the website features a custom layout with carefully crafted styles to ensure a smooth user experience across all devices.

With a modern design, the website includes high-quality images, well-structured content, and interactive elements to engage visitors. Smooth transitions, hover effects, and animations enhance the visual appeal, making navigation intuitive and enjoyable. The layout is structured to provide essential information about the gym, its facilities, fitness programs, membership plans, and trainers.

The website is designed with flexbox and grid layouts to achieve responsiveness without relying on frameworks. Custom CSS animations and transitions are used to add a dynamic feel, while a well-organized stylesheet ensures maintainability.

This project showcases expertise in front-end web development, focusing on pure HTML and CSS to build a stylish, functional, and responsive website without external frameworks. It highlights skills in designing custom UI components, structuring content effectively, and optimizing the user experience.
